# About Me

Hi! My name is **Boran Zhang**, and I am a first-year **ScM student in Biostatistics** at Johns Hopkins University.  
I am originally from **Beijing, China**, where I completed my undergraduate studies at **Guanghua School of Management, Peking University**, majoring in **Economics**.

My current research interests focus on **statistical methods in genomics** — developing and applying statistical tools to understand genetic variation and its relationship to human health and disease.

Outside of academics, I enjoy playing **League of Legends** in my free time.
